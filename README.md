- Training on 14.8T high-quality tokens
- Impressive speed of 60 tokens/second (3x faster than V2)
- Full API compatibility with previous versions

## Features

- Modern Next.js-based web interface
- Tailwind CSS for sleek, responsive design
- TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience
- Integration with DeepSeek-V3's powerful language model
- Environment variable configuration for secure API handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/martinbowling/deepbuild.git
cd deepbuild
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Configure Environment Variables:
You can configure the application in two ways:

a) Using environment files (`.env` or `.env.local`):
Create a `.env` or `.env.local` file in the project root with any of the following variables to override the Web GUI settings:

```bash
# Required - Choose your API provider
API_PROVIDER=deepseek           # Options: 'deepseek' or 'hyperbolic'

# DeepSeek Configuration
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
DEEPSEEK_API_BASE=https://api.deepseek.com/v1  # Optional: Custom API endpoint

# Hyperbolic Configuration
HYPERBOLIC_API_KEY=your_hyperbolic_api_key_here
HYPERBOLIC_API_BASE=https://api.hyperbolic.xyz # Optional: Custom API endpoint

# Model Settings (applies to both providers)
MODEL_VERSION=deepseek-v3       # Model version
MAX_TOKENS=2048                 # Maximum tokens per request
TEMPERATURE=0.7                 # Response temperature (0-1)
TOP_P=0.95                      # Top P sampling (0-1)
FREQUENCY_PENALTY=0.0           # Frequency penalty (-2.0 to 2.0)
PRESENCE_PENALTY=0.0            # Presence penalty (-2.0 to 2.0)

# Advanced Settings
CACHE_ENABLED=true             # Enable/disable response caching
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=60000          # Request timeout in milliseconds
```

Environment variables take precedence over Web GUI settings. Any variable defined in `.env` or `.env.local` will override the corresponding setting in the Web GUI. This allows you to:
- Set default values for deployment
- Override settings for different environments
- Keep sensitive information like API keys out of the Web GUI
- Lock certain settings for production use

b) Using the Web GUI:
If no environment variables are set, or you prefer a visual interface, you can configure all settings through the web interface after starting the application. The GUI provides:
- Provider selection between DeepSeek and Hyperbolic
- API key management
- Model parameter configuration
- Advanced settings adjustment

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
